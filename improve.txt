- inline and block math are causing some problems ... when they show up (I dont see math much but looks bad if it shows up)

- Spacing is weird, especially due to lists, updating padding and margin in MarkdownComponents is not resolving the problems.


- There is a path for not prompting the DB when not asking for both a region and company
    - Time series?
