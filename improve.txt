- inline and block math are causing some problems ... when they show up (I dont see math much but looks bad if it shows up)

- Spacing is weird, especially due to lists, updating padding and margin in MarkdownComponents is not resolving the problems.


- There is a path for not prompting the DB when not asking for both a region and company
    - Time series?


- In the cleanMD util function, I may clean out tables, which should be kept as they are good to visualize the data
    - this might not be the case, but still getting bullets above what they should be bulets for
    
    
    
    
    
    - indenting for subsections should be importnat as well

        ```
        let lines = rawText.split("\n");
        let formatted = [];

        for (let line of lines) {
        if (line.trim() === "") continue;

        if (/:\s*\$\d/.test(line)) {
            // Indent line if it's a price line (e.g., "6-inch: $7.09")
            formatted.push(`  - ${line.trim()}`);
        } else {
            // Treat as top-level item
            formatted.push(`- **${line.trim()}**`);
        }
        }

        return formatted.join("\n");
        ```
