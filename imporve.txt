- initial message is behind the header because of the scrolling

- the messages are not cached properly, probably because of the way the message lists are created in page.tsx
they go away upon reload

- of course, keep on tuining the llm prompting for better results. 
Maybge also add a path that just looks at message history to keep up the conversation and provide more insights to the user.
